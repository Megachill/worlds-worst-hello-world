# Worlds Worst Hello World Workshop

## The challenge:
Write the worst implementation of hello world you possibly can in an hour. That's it. Winner get's a prize.

## The prize:
A giant homemade elephphant pillow (seriously, I'm already jealous of the winner).

## Requirements
- A computer
- PHP ^5.6
- Composer
- A desire to inflict terrible code upon your fellow devs

## How to play
1. Decide wether you want to compete alone or as a team
1. Fork this repo
2. Clone the fork to your local machine
3. Run `composer update` (to get PHPUnit)
4. Run `./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/HelloTest.php` and watch the test pass
5. Call forth the dark ancient ones. Let their arcane knowledge seep into your soul, forever dooming you to madeness (optional step, but it will give you an edge in this context). 
6. Write terrible code that passes the test
7. Submit your code using either of the following
  - Email (contact@barryosull.com)
  - Twitter (@phpdublin, #worldworstphp)
8. The PHPDublin team will spend 10 to 15 mins judging the entries, then we'll announce a winner.

## What you can edit
This repo comes with a single test case. This testcase runs a simple php script, called "hello.php", that's it.
You cannot change the testcase, but you can do whatever you want to hello.php. Anything goes. As long as it passes the test, it's good.

## How bad are we talking?
Pretty much anything.

## Tips/Suggestions
While you're allowed to do anything you like, keep in mind that we need to be able to judge your code. This means we need to be able to read/understand it to some degree. Here are some tips.
- Don't purposely obfuscate
- Format the code so that's it at least readible
- Be pointlessly clever
- More design patterns == better
- Use whatever libraries you want, go wild with composer!
- Use infrastructure (s3, DBs, etc..), but if you do, you'llneed to prove it works on your machine (as we won't have that infra)
