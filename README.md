## The challenge:
Write the worst implementation of hello world you possibly can in an hour.

Second, clone the fork to your local machine.

This repo comes with a single test case. This testcase includes a a single "hello.php", that's it.
You cannot change the testcode, but you can do whatever you want to hello.php. Anything. As long as it passes the test, it's good.

## Getting started
This repo is the starting line for the workshop/hackathon/whatever-you-wanna-call-it.

## The rules
You must complete it within the hour
You must have the code on github
It must work when run

## How bad are we talking?
Pretty much anything.
